(** Unicode string library - Ustring.
    Version 0.01
    This module implements Unicode variants of functions using strings
    in the OCaml standard library, e.g., modules [String] and [Pervasives].
    There are also a number of additional functions available. Several
    basic operators (e.g., equality and string concatenation) are defined in
    sub module {!Ustring.Op}. It is recommended to open up this sub module
    but not [Ustring] directly.

    This module currently supports ASCII, Latin-1, and UTF-8 encoding. If
    another encoding is used, an exception will be raised. In all functions
    below, a ustring [s] is indexed from [0] to [(Ustring.length s)-1].

      [Ustring.fast_append]. Compared to function [append] and
    standard string concatenation operator [^], function [fast_append] do not
    allocate new memory or create a new fresh string. Instead,
    the concatenation is internally stored as a tree, making
    the operation constant time. When the string is later used by some function
    in module [Ustring], the internal tree representation will be automatically
    collapsed to a plain string. Note that in contrary to [append], this
    function do not create a fresh new string directly. Hence, if the sub strings
    are shared and modified in place, this string will also be updated. To

  (** Safe structural equality operator for ustrings. For performance reason, an

(** Append/concatenation of two strings. This function is equivalent to
    infix operator [^..]. Please see module {!Ustring.Op} for more details about the

(** [starts_with w s] returns true if string [s] starts with [w]. *)

val ends_with : ustring -> ustring -> bool
(** [ends_with w s] returns true if string [s] ends with [w]. For instance,

val unix2dos : string -> string

    module handles all strings internally using line feed (LF) code 0x0A, which
    is standard in Unix-like systems (e.g., GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD).
    All input functions (e.g., [from_utf8()] or [from_latin1()]) automatically
    converts to this format. Hence, when ustrings are encoded using e.g.
    LATIN-1 or UTF-8, they will only contain the LF charcter for new line.
    However, for example Windows, DOS, OS/2 and Symbian OS are using
    the sequence of Carriage return (CR) 0x0D and LF 0x0A. This function
    converts from unix-style to this format. *)

val string2hex : string -> ustring
(** Function [Ustring.string2hex s] returns a comma separated list of hex

(** Converts escaped characters. Raises
      [Invalid_argument "convert_escaped_chars"] if the string contains

val read_file : ?encode_type:encoding -> string -> ustring
(** Function [Ustring.read_file fn] returns a ustring of the whole contents
    of a file with file name [fn]. By default, the encoding type is [Auto]
    (see type [encoding] for details). The input can also be forced to be
    assumed to be another encoding type. For example, expression
    [Ustring.read_file ~encode_type:Ustring.Utf8 fn] creates
    an ustring that will assume that the input file is encoded using UTF-8.
    If there is a decoding error exception [Decode_error enc pos] is raised.
    Argument [enc] is the encoding type
    and [pos] is number of bytes read from the file when the decoding error

    from the file.*)

val write_file : ?encode_type:encoding -> string -> ustring -> unit
(** Function [Ustring.write_file fn s] writes unicode string [s] to a
    a file named [fn]. The default character encoding is UTF-8. *)

val read_from_channel : ?encode_type:encoding -> in_channel -> int -> ustring
(** Function [Ustring.read_from_channel ic] returns a function which
    can read from the in_channel. The returned function has one argument stating
    the number of Unicode characters that should be read from the stream.
    It returns an ustring with the read characters. The length of the
    returned ustring is approximately the requested number of characters,
    i.e., the function can do a partial read. If the returned ustring has
    length zero, the end of the character stream has been reached. If there is
    a decoding error exception [Decode_error enc pos] is raised. Argument
    [enc] is the encoding type and [pos] is number of bytes read from the
    file when the decoding error occurred. Note that this function should
    only be called once to get the read function [int -> ustring] and no
    other function is allowed to read from this channel at the same time.*)

    must not have a byte order mark (BOM). *)

val from_uchars : uchar array -> ustring
(** Converts an array of uchars to an ustring. Raises exception
    [Invalid_argument "Ustring.from_uchars"] if uchar values are illegal
    (must be in range 0x0-0x1FFFFF). *)

val latin1_to_uchar : char -> uchar
(** Converts a Latin-1 encoded char to an uchar *)

val to_latin1 : ustring -> string
(** Creates a new string encoded using Latin-1. Raises
    [Invalid_argument "Ustring.to_latin1"] if the characters are not within
    the ASCII and Latin-1 character set (values 0-255). *)

val to_utf8 : ustring -> string
(** Returns an UTF-8 encoded string. An UTF-8 string consist of a sequence of
    bytes where each Unicode character is encoded into 1 to 4 bytes. ASCII
    characters are always encoded into 1 byte. *)

    that needs 3 bytes), the number of characters that represent
    whole characters are return. Raises exception

val lexing_from_channel : ?encode_type:encoding -> in_channel -> Lexing.lexbuf
(** Creates a new [Lexing.lexbuf] on a given input channel. Expression
    [Ustring.lexing_from_channel inchan] returns a lexer buffer that reads
    from input channel [inchan]. By default, the encoding type is [Auto]
    (see type [encoding] for details). The input can also be forced to be
    assumed to be another encoding type. For example, expression

    a lexbuf that will assume that the input data is encoded using UTF-8.
    The stream of characters that are returned to the lexical analyzer is

    [inchan], Raises exception [Decode_error enc pos] if there is a decoding
    error of the data read from  [inchan]. Argument [enc] is the encoding type
    and [pos] is number of bytes read from [inchan] when the decoding error
    occurred. *)

val lexing_from_ustring : ustring -> Lexing.lexbuf
(** Creates a new [Lexing.lexbuf] that reads from a ustring. The stream of
    characters that are returned to the lexical analyzer is
    always UTF-8. *)

(** {6 Comparison and Standard Collections} *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** Safe structural equality comparison function for ustrings.
    For easy usage, use the equivalent operator [=.] which is defined in
    module {!Ustring.Op}. *)

val not_equal : t -> t -> bool
(** Safe structural inequality comparison function for ustrings.
    For easy usage, use the equivalent operator [<>.] which is defined in
    module {!Ustring.Op}. *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** Comparison function for ustrings. Uses the same specification as
    [Pervasives.compare]. Since both type [t] and function [compare] is
    implemented, module [UString] can be passed directly to functors such
    as [Set.Make] and [Map.Make]. For example, to create a map the uses
    ustrings as the key, use the following source code line:

    [module USMap = Map.Make (Ustring)] *)

val hash : t -> int
(** Implements a safe hash function for ustrings. Since type [t] and
    functions [hash] and [equal] are implemented, module [UString] can
    be passed directly to functor Hashtbl.Make, making it simple to
    use ustrings as keys in a hash table. For example, to create a
    hash table that uses ustrings as keys, use the following source
    code line:

    [module USHash = Hashtbl.Make(Ustring)] *)
