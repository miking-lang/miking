"Usage: mi <command> [<options>] file [<options>]

Commands:
  eval       Evaluates a .mc file using an internal interpreter
  compile    Compiles a .mc file into an executable with the same name
  run        Combines eval and compile, to run the program as fast as possible
  tune       Tunes a program with holes

If no command is given, the file will be executed using the run command
and all arguments after the file are arguments to the .mc executed file.
In such case, options need to be written before the file name.
