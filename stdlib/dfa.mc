-- Represents a deterministic finite automaton.
-- Equality and print functions are required for
-- the states (eqv,s2s) and labels (eql,l2s) for the
-- construct function (dfaConstr).

-- States are represented by a vertex in a directed graph.
-- They are unique values, there cannot be two states
-- whose value of the equality function is true.

-- transitions are represented as edges in a directed graph
-- (digraph), where the vertices are states. All labels between two states
-- also has to be unique.

-- adds syntactic sugar for DFA type
-- DFA is based on the same data types as the NFA
type DFA = NFA
