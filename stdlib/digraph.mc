-- Represents a directed graph with labeled edges.
--
-- Vertices and labels can be of any data types, as long as they have an
-- equality function.
--
-- An edge is represented as a triple (from, to, label), where the edge goes
-- from "from" to "to", and "label" is the label of the edge. There can be
-- several edges between two vertices.
--
-- Vertices must be unique: there cannot be two vertices whose value of the
-- equality function is true. This is maintained as invariant. Similarly, labels
-- between any pair of vertices must be unique; this is also maintained as
-- invariant.
