-- Represents a directed graph with labeled edges.

-- Vertices and labels can be of any data types, as long as they have an
-- equality function (given as arguments to the graph when created).

-- An edge is represented as a triple (from, to, label), where the edge goes
-- from "from" to "to", and "label" is the label of the edge. There can be
-- several edges between two vertices.

-- Vertices must be unique: there cannot be two vertices whose value of the
-- equality function is true. This is maintained as invariant. Similarly, labels
-- between any pair of vertices must be unique; this is also maintained as
-- invariant.

-- Presently, the graph is implemented using an adjacency map, which maps each
-- vertex to a list of outgoing edges from that vertex.
