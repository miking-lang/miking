-- A generic library for (stochastic) local search algorithms.
--
-- To design a local search algorithm, provide implementations for the semantic
-- functions in the language fragment 'LocalSearchBase'. The syn 'MetaState' can
-- be used to maintain meta-information between search iterations. See the
-- fragments 'LocalSearchSimulatedAnnealing' and 'LocalSearchTabuSearch' for an
-- implementation of simulated annealing and tabu search, respectively.
--
-- The tests contain an implementation of the travelling salesman problem (TSP).
-- See this example for how to use the pre-defined language fragments as
-- building blocks when implementing local search for this problem.
